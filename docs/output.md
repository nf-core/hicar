# nf-core/hicar: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the plots are taken from the MultiQC report, which summarises results at the end of the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

## Pipeline overview

### FastQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `fastqc/`
  - `*_fastqc.html`: FastQC report containing quality metrics.
  - `*_fastqc.zip`: Zip archive containing the FastQC report, tab-delimited data file and plot images.

</details>

[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) gives general quality metrics about your sequenced reads. It provides information about the quality score distribution across your reads, per base sequence content (%A/T/G/C), adapter contamination and overrepresented sequences. For further reading and documentation see the [FastQC help pages](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/).

### MultiQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `multiqc/`
  - `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
  - `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.
  - `multiqc_plots/`: directory containing static images from the report in various formats.

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from supported tools e.g. FastQC. The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.
  - Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.
  - Parameters used by the pipeline run: `params.json`.

</details>

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.

### Genome

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `genome/`
  - `genome.fa.sizes`: chromosome sizes file
  - `genome.fa.fai`: genome index file
  - `filtered/genome.include_regions.bed`: filtered genome by blacklist
  - `digest/*`: genomic features files digested by given restriction enzyme

</details>

If the mappability file is not provided in the profile file, the [GenMap](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32246826/) will be used to create the mappability file with read length set to 50.

### Alignment

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `bwa/mapped/QC/*`: The stats of mapping results.

</details>

Adapter-trimmed reads are mapped to the reference assembly using [BWA::mem](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml). A genome index is required to run BWA so if this is not provided explicitly using the `--bwa_index` parameter then it will be created automatically from the genome fasta input. The index creation process can take a while for larger genomes.

### Kraken2

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `kraken2/*.report.txt`: The output files of Kraken2.
- `kraken2/krona/*`: The krona html file.

  - `filtered/*`: The filtered files in hdf5 and pairs format. The hdf5 files in the folder can be used to generate virtual 4C plots.
  - `QC/*`: The quality analysis results.

</details>

The raw and filtered pairs exported by [pairtools](https://pairtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
The quality analysis for filtered pairs were done by [pairsqc](https://github.com/4dn-dcic/pairsqc).

The hdf5 filtered pairs contains following groups:

- `header/`, including total reads, chromosome name and sizes, tile width for index.
  - `header/chrom_sizes`, COMPOUND
  - `header/header`, STRING
  - `header/tile_width`, INTEGER
  - `header/total`, INTEGER
- `data/`, pairs in path `data/chr1_for_R1_reads/chr2_for_R2_reads/tileIndex1_tileIndex2/`, the tile index is calculated by the ceiling of posistion divided by tile width.
  - `position`, genomic location saved in path `data/chr1/chr2/tileIndex1_tileIndex2/position`
  - `strand`, strand info saved in `path data/chr1/chr2/tileIndex1_tileIndex2/strand`

- `matrix/mcool/*`: The mcool files for each group.
- `matrix/hic/*`: The .hic files for each group.
- `matrix/HiCExplorer/*`: The h5 files normalized by HiCExplorer for each group.

</details>

[Cooler](https://cooler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) files for visualization.
To view the `.mcool` files, you may want to try [higlass-manage](https://github.com/higlass/higlass-manage).
Once `higlass-manage` is installed, view the files using the command:

```bash
higlass-manage view cooler/mcool/your.mcool
```

[Juicebox](https://github.com/aidenlab/Juicebox) can be used to view the `.hic` file.
Visualizing the `.hic` file with Juicebox is an alternative when `higlass-manage` is not available.

### Call peaks for R2 reads

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `atac_peak/`
  - `R2_bigwig/*`: The bigWig files of R2_reads.
  - `peaks_per_Group/*`: The called peaks for each group.
  - `merged_peaks/*`: The merged peaks for all groups.
  - `QC/*`: The quality controls

</details>

The peaks called ATAC reads (R2 reads) by [MACS2](https://github.com/macs3-project/MACS).
Different from ATAC-seq peak calling, the ATAC reads in HiCAR is single end.
By default, the peaks are called by `--no-model` parameter for the R2 reads in BED format.

### Compartments

<details markdown="1">

  - `HiCExplorer/`
    - `*`: By default, all intermediate matrices will be generated: obs_exp-all.h5, pearson_all.h5 and covariance_all.h5.

</details>

To compute the A/B compartments ask correlation matrix computed by observed/expected matrix in the way described by [Lieberman-Aiden](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1181369) and are determined by the eigenvectors based on the covariance matrix of the correlation matrix.

### TADs

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `tads`
  - `cooltools/`
    - `*`: The called TADs.

</details>

To call TADs by [HiCExplorer](https://hicexplorer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/example_usage.html#tad-calling),
a corrected matrix is needed. The TAD-separation score is based on a Z-score matrix for all bins.
The TAD-separation score and the matrix will be visualized using [hicPlotTADs](https://hicexplorer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/hicPlotTADs.html#hicplottads).

### Chromatin interactions

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

  - `hicdcplus/`
    - `merged/*`: The merged loops for each resolution.
    - `*`: The tables of chromatin interactions with p-value and fdr.
  - `maps/`
    - `merged/*`: The merged loops for each resolution.
    - `*`: The tables of chromatin interactions with p-value and fdr.
  - `peakachu/`
    - `merged/*`: The merged loops for each resolution.
    - `*`: The bedpe files of chromatin interactions with peakachu scores.

</details>

Use different caller to call chromatin loops/interactions can be done by set the parameter `--interactions_tool` in command line or `interactions_tool` in the configuration file.

The default chromatin interactions are called by [MAPS](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30986246/).
MAPS is a model-based analysis of long-range chromatin interactions for `AND` or `XOR` reads.

- `AND` set: bin pairs with `both` ends overlapping two anchors of interaction.
- `XOR` set: bin pairs with one end overlapping one anchor of the interaction.

It will remove the systematic bias by accessibility.
By default, the interactions are called by `positive poisson` regression model
and then filtered by coverage (default is 12 per bin), fold change (default is 2 times over expected value) and fdr (default is 0.01).

The chromatin interactions called by [HiCDCPlus](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23749-x)
and [peakachu](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17239-9) or other tools are also located in interactions folder.

### Differential analysis

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `differential_analysis/<differential analysis tool>/<interaction caller>/*`: Differential analysis results.

</details>

Differential analysis for the loops by [edgeR](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19910308/),
[diffHic](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-015-0683-0) or simply set operation will be put in the folder.
The subfolder names are the tools used in differential analysis and in each subfolder,
different resolution results will be saved in another subfolder.

The input counts are filtered counts dumped by pairtools for each samples.
The differential analysis is done for validated chromatin interactions by loop caller.

### Annotations

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `annotations/<interaction caller>/*`: Annotation results.

</details>

Annotation is done by [ChIPpeakAnno](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20459804/)

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `fragment_peak/`
  - `R1_bigwig/`
    - `byGroup/*`: The bigWig files of R1_reads for each group.
    - `pos1/*`: The bigWig files of 5' ends of R1_reads.
  - `merged_peaks/merged_peak.bed`: The bed file with merged R1 peaks from all samples.
  - `peaks_per_Group/*`: The MACS2 output for each group.

</details>

The peaks called fragment (R1) reads by fitting the reads counts in fragmentation sites with Poisson distribution.
The fragment reads will be more noisy compare to ATAC (R2) reads and the p value cutoff will be higher to get proper peaks for interaction calling.

### High resolution interactions

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `high_peak`
  - `*/`: The high resolution interactions in bedpe format and tab delimited format.

</details>

The HiCAR `fastq` files are paired ends (PE). But it will be difficult to check the reads in pairs for [IGV](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/).
In order to view the reads located in the R1 and R2 peaks, the `psuedo-bam` files are created by adding insertion to the PE and converted as single ends.
When the `psuedo-bam` file is load to IGV, the PEs will be linked by a line, which will help user to double check the reads located in the chromation interactions.
The high resolution chromatin interactions (HiPeak) are called by similar methods like [MAPS](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30986246/) to remove the systematic bias by accessibility.
The difference is that HiPeak will also consider the trans-interactions.
The output of HiPeak is designed for motif enrichment analysis.
