    description: 'Table of mapped reads stats. The duplication rate should be lower than 50%. 20%~30% is a good level for 60M PE reads for the human genome. For shallow sequencing, <30% duplication rate should be the cutting value for further deep sequencing. Too low duplication rate (<5%) may indicate low specific chromatin interactions. These numbers are estimated by several hypothesis. We set the actual mappable genome size to 70% of the original genome size. And the open chromatin interacts region is about 2% of the genome. Take the human genome as an example, the possible unique reads for 60M will be, (3G * 70% * 2%)/60M, about 70%. This is about a 30% duplication rate. Those hypotheses are consistent with real data of ChIP-seq<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24782889/"></a>.'

    helptext: |
      *Fraction of reads in peaks (FRiP)* – Fraction of all mapped reads that fall into the called peak regions,
      i.e. usable reads in significantly enriched peaks divided by all usable reads.
      In general, FRiP scores correlate positively with the number of regions.
      ([Landt et al, Genome Research Sept. 2012, 22(9): 1813–1831](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22955991/).
      *FRiP should be greater than 1%*

      *TSS enrichment score* is a ratio between aggregate distribution of reads centered on TSSs
      and that flanking the corresponding TSSs.
      TSS score = the depth of TSS (each 100bp window within 1000 bp each side) / the depth of end flanks (100bp each end).
      TSSE score = max(mean(TSS score in each window)).
      TSS enrichment score is calculated according to the definition at [ENCODE TSSE score](https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/terms/#enrichment).
      Transcription start site (TSS) enrichment values are dependent on the reference files used;
      cutoff values for high quality data are listed in the following table from
      [ENCODE ATAC-seq QC](https://www.encodeproject.org/atac-seq/).
      For HiCAR, only R2 reads is used in TSSE score calculation and reads enrichment is following
      exponential ratio, we adjusted the TSSE score range.
      TSSEscore < 1.5: concerning;
      TSSEscore 1.5-3.5: acceptable;
      TSSEscore > 3.5: Ideal.

      Promoter/Transcript body proportions is test for the R2 reads enriched in promoters or in transcript body.
